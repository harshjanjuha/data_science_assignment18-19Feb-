    "Q3. What is App routing in Flask? Why do we use app routes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans.In Flask, app routing is the process of associating a URL with a Python function, which is known as a view function. When a user visits a URL, Flask uses the associated view function to generate the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use app routes in Flask to create a RESTful API. This allows us to define multiple endpoints for our application and map each endpoint to a corresponding view function. By using app routes, we can easily handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and parameters passed through the URL or the request body. App routes also help in organizing the codebase and making it easier to maintain.\n"
